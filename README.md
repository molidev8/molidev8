# Hi!üëã My name is Miguel Olivera
### I'm a sofware engineer mostly interested in mobile development and IoT devices. I've been developing in Android with Kotlin since 2019 and I have also basic knowledge of native iOS development with Swift, hybrid technologies like Xamarin and Flutter and IoT devices. I'm currently working as a junior android developer since 2021.
